# Policy model

Pollution, $CO_2$ emissions and environmental issues are being more and more critical. In order to motivate industrial leaders to use clean methods of energy production, $CO_2$ taxes are applied based on $CO_2$ emitted. The aim of the policy model is to adapt the price of these $CO_2$ taxes regarding CCS price and the environmental damage price.

## Environmental damage price

Emitting $CO_2$  and pollution in general cause different sorts of environmental damage. A price of these damages can be estimated, through the Damage model.

## CCS price

Carbon Capture and Storage regroups different technologies that aim to capture $CO_2$ emitted and then to stock it instead of releasing it in the atmosphere. It is a way to turn non-green energy way of production into zero-emission way of energy production (like coal burning or methane burning). However, this implies to build a factory, and it costs money.

## Policy result

In order to guide industry to green energy, $CO_2$ taxes are adapted to be the maximum between CCS price and environmental damage price. In this way, it will always be better to invest into green energy or CCS, regarding money (and environment of course).
