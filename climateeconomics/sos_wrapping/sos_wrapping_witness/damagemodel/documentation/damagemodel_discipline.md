# Summary

This document explores the relationship between global warming and its impact on the economy, driven by different damage functions. It implements two equations for the damage model: the Standard DICE model and a Tipping Point model. Users can choose between them by setting the `tipping_point` input. The time step and period parameters are adjustable to simulate various scenarios. Graphs illustrate the differences between the models, and references provide further reading on the subject.

# Damage Functions

The relationship between global warming and its impact on the economy is driven by the damage function. We have implemented two different equations for the damage model:

- Standard DICE: the DICE model equation [^1]
- Tipping point: a more drastic version with damage acceleration.
  You can choose between them by changing the input `tipping_point`: if `tipping_point = False` then the standard DICE is used and if `tipping_point = True` the tipping point version is used.

## Standard DICE Damage

In DICE[^1] model, the damage function gives a relationship between temperature increase and economic damage. The fraction of output loss due to climate change $\Omega_t$ at $t$ is:
$$\Omega_t = \pi_1 T_{t\,AT}+ \pi_2 T_{t\,AT}^\varepsilon$$
where $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are `damage_int` and `damage_quad` in the inputs. $T_{t\,AT}$ is the atmospheric temperature increase (see Temperature change model documentation). $\varepsilon$ (`damage_expo`) represents the form of the relationship between temperature and economic damage. We set the default value to $\varepsilon = 2$, such that we have a quadratic relationship. It can be modified by changing the input `damage_expo`.
Total damage in trillions of dollars is then:
$$Damages_t = \Omega _t. Y_t$$
with $Y_t$ the gross economic output in trillions of dollars (see macroeconomics documentation).
The form of the damage fraction in the latest version of DICE (2017) is different between the documentation[^1] and the code[^3]. We chose to implement the equation from the code which is the one used to obtain the results.

## Tipping Point

We use another equation for the damage model from Weitzman (2009)[^2][^4] based on the assumption that once temperatures increase above a given point, damages may accelerate. In this version damages drastically increase after a temperature $T_3$ currently set to 3.5°C (more on that in next section). We have then:
$$D_t = \left(\frac{T_{t\,AT}}{20.46}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{T_{t\,AT}}{T_3}\right)^{6.754}$$
and
$$\Omega_t = \frac{D_t}{1 + D_t}$$
As before, we have the total economics damage in trillions dollars:
$$Damages_t = \Omega _t. Y_t$$

> The severity of the damage model can be modified by adjusting the variable A3 in the GUI in expert mode (referred to as `tp_a3` in the model).

### Controversy on Tipping Point Value

The damage function significantly influences GDP and policy making. The DICE model and other IAMs traditionally do not account for tipping points, assuming these occur at 3°C or higher or over a 300-year timescale. This conservative approach has been criticized for underestimating climate change impacts.

The macroeconomics model is highly dependent on the damage model which is highly sensitive to the
tipping point temperature (when using the tipping point damage function, which is currently the case). This original value of `tp_a3 = 6.081°C` in Weitzman's model was taken from a subjective probability
estimate among 52 experts of triggering a « tipping point of major changes » in each of five possible
categories:

1. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)
2. The Greenland ice sheet metltdown
3. West Antarctic Ice Sheet meltdown
4. Amazon rainforest
5. El Nino/southern Oscillation

At $T_{t\,AT}=6.081°C$, the expected probability is 3/5 [^4].

However, that original tipping point value of 6.081°C has been critized for several reasons:

- **Criticism of Existing Models**: Keen et al. (2021) argue that conservative models misinform climate policy and should be rejected [^7].
- **Underestimation of Climate Change Costs**: Higher tipping points have led IAMs to underestimate the social cost of carbon and overestimate the cost of emission reductions, resulting in suboptimal climate policies[^7]
- **Call for Realistic Assumptions**: Correcting these errors suggests economic damages from climate change could be much worse than forecasted, necessitating immediate and realistic consideration of lower tipping points.

Some paper suggest radically different values :

- $T_{3}=3°C$ [^5] (p.34)
- $T_{3}=1-2°C$ [^6][^7].

### Implementation of 3.5°C Tipping Point

To provide a more accurate representation of climate-economic impacts, we have adjusted the tipping point value from 6.081°C to 3.5°C. This reflects a more immediate and realistic threshold for accelerated climate damages, aligning the model with current scientific understanding and expert warnings.
