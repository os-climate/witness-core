# Temperature model

The temperature model computes the evolution of atmospheric and ocean temperature following change in $CO_2$ concentration. It contains three equations, onet for the radiative forcing and two equations for the climate system, all extracted from DICE[^1] model with no modification (Nordhaus, 2017).

## Time step

The time step $t$ in each equation represents the period we are looking at. In the inputs we initialise the data with 2020 information. The user can choose the year end and the duration of the period (in years) by changing the parameters $year\, end$ and $time \,step$. For example, for a year start at 2020, year end in 2100 and a duration of time step of 5 years we have $t \, \epsilon \,[0, 16]$.

## Radiative forcing

Various metrics intermediate between cause and effect are used to provide estimates of the climate impact of individual factors. Radiative forcing (RF) is one of the most widely used metrics. Though usually difficult to observe, calculated radiative forcing provides a simple quantitative basis for comparing some aspects of the potential climate response to different imposed agents, especially global mean temperature, and hence is widely used in the scientific community. [^2]

The radiative forcing refers to an instantaneous change in net (down minus up) radiative flux (shortwave plus longwave; in Watts per m2) due to an imposed change. This forcing is usually defined in terms of flux changes at the top of the atmosphere.

Different anthropogenic emissions are impacting the climate change and these impacts should be modeled with radiative forcing.

In the following graph, you can observe the temperature response by component for total anthropogenic emissions for a 1-year pulse.

Longer and higher temperature responses are due to $CO_2$, CH4 and N2O emissions. Consequently, the majority of climate IAM models compute radiative forcing of these three greenhouse gases, respectively $CO_2$, CH4 and N2O molecules.

### DICE Radiative forcing model

The radiative forcing model of DICE takes into account only $CO_2$ radiative forcing with a logarithm variation and other radiative forcing are computed with a linear model assumption (based on a given SSP scenario):

$$RF_t = \eta.\frac{\ln(C_{CO_2}^t) - ln(C_{CO_2}^{1750})}{ln(2)}+F_{t\,EX}$$
$RF_t$ in watts per $m^2$, $C_{CO_2}^t$ the atmospheric concentration of $CO_2$ in Gtc (defined in Carbon Cycle model), $C_{CO_2}^{1750}$ the level of $CO_2$ atmospheric concentration before industrial revolution, $\eta$ the increase in forcing from the doubling of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere and $RF_{t\,EX}$ forcing from gases other than $CO_2$ at $t$.
If $t < t_{max}$:
$$RF_{t\,EX}= RF_{0\,EX} + \frac{1}{17}(RF_{t_{max}\,EX} - F_{0\,EX}).(t-1)$$
and for $t = t_{max}:\:RF_{t\,EX}= RF_{t_{max}\,EX}$ corresponding to $hundred\_forcing\_nonco$ in the inputs and $t_{max}$ the last period.

### Myhre Radiative forcing model [^3]

In the paper of Myhre &al [^3], the greenhouse gases radiative forcing is based on 3 major gas emissions: $CO_2$, CH4 and N20. The $CO_2$ radiative forcing is expressed as in DICE formulation:

$$RF_{CO_2,t} = \eta.\frac{\ln(C_{CO_2}^t) - ln(C_{CO_2}^{1750})}{ln(2)}$$

The CH4 and N2O radiative forcing equation is the following:

$$RF_{CH4,N2O,t} = 0.036 (\sqrt{C_{CH4}^t}-\sqrt{C_{CH4}^{1750}}) - MN(C_{CH4}^t,C_{N20}^{1750})  \\ + 0.12 (\sqrt{C_{N2O}^t}-\sqrt{C_{N2O}^{1750}}) -MN(C_{CH4}^{1750}t,C_{N20}^{t}) \\ + 2MN(C_{CH4}^{1750},C_{N20}^{1750})$$

with $MN$ a function defined as:

$$
MN(c1,c2) =0.47 \log(1 + 2.01.10^{-5}  (c_1  c_2)^{0.75} +
                                 5.31.10^{-15}  c_1  (c_1 c_2)^{1.52})
$$

The Myhre equation is mainly used in climate change models such as in MAGICC [^4], FUND [^5] or FAIR [^6] models.

### Etminan Radiative forcing model [^7]

The model of Etminan [^7] is an improved version of the Myhre model especially for methane emissions impact:

$$RF_{CO_2,t} = \eta_{CO_2,Etminan}(\ln(C_{CO_2}^t) - ln(C_{CO_2}^{1750}))$$

with:

$$ \eta*{CO_2,Etminan} = -2.4.10^{-7} (C*{CO*2}^t - C*{CO*2}^{1750})^2 + 7.2.10^{-4} abs(C*{CO*2}^t - C*{CO*2}^{1750}) \\ -2.1.10^{-4} \times n2o*{mean} + \frac{\eta}{np.log(2)} $$

$$n2o_{mean}= \frac{1}{2}(C_{N2O}^t + C_{N2O}^{1750})$$

The CH4 and N2O radiative forcing equation is the following:

$$RF_{CH4,t} = \eta_{CH4,Etminan}(\sqrt{C_{CH4}^t}-\sqrt{C_{CH4}^{1750}})$$

$$RF_{N2O,t} = \eta_{N2O,Etminan}(\sqrt{C_{N2O}^t}-\sqrt{C_{N2O}^{1750}})$$

with:

$$\eta_{CH4,Etminan} = -1.3e-6 \times ch4_{mean} - 8.2e-6 \times n2o_{mean} + 0.043 $$

$$\eta_{N2O,Etminan} = -8.0e-6 \times co2_{mean} + 4.2e-6 \times n2o_{mean} - 4.9e-6 \times ch4_{mean} + 0.117 $$

$$co2{mean}= \frac{1}{2}(C_{CO_2}^t + C_{CO_2}^{1750})$$
$$ch4_{mean}= \frac{1}{2}(C_{CH4}^t + C_{CH4}^{1750})$$

The Etminan equation is used in FAIR [^6] model.

### MeinsHausen Radiative forcing model [^8]

The model of MeinsHausen is another improved version of the Myhre model (See [^8] for more details on equations). The model is used in FAIR [^6] model.

### Atmospheric temperature

Radiative forcing warms up the atmosphere which leads to a warm up in the upper ocean and then the lower ocean. The increase in atmospheric temperature in degree celsius is:
$$T_{t\,AT} = T_{t-1\,AT} + \xi_1[F_t - \lambda T_{t-1} - \xi_2(T_{t-1} - T_{t-1\,LO})]$$
with $\xi_i$ the transfer coefficients reflecting the rates of flow and thermal capacities of the sinks for a $time step$ = 5 that we adapt to the current time step. $\xi_1$ is $climate\_upper$ in the inputs and $\xi_2$ is $transfer\_upper$. Lastly $\lambda  = \frac{forcing\_eq\_$CO_2$}{eq\_temp\_impact}$ is climate sensitivity.

### Ocean temperature

The increase in ocean temperature is:
$$T_{t\,LO} = T_{t-1\,LO} + \xi_3(T_{t-1} - T_{t-1\,LO})$$
with $\frac{1}{\xi_3}$ the transfer rate from the upper ocean to the deep ocean ($transfer\_lower$ in the inputs).
