## Redistribution of resources

#### Energy

Inputs :
- Total energy production (out of EnergyMixDiscipline)
- Share (%) of the total energy production attributed to each sector

Output:
- for each sector :

$$ allocated\ energy\ for\ sector\ S = Share\ energy\ sector\ S \times Total\ energy\ production\ S$$

- Total :

$$ Total\ allocated\ energy\ = Sum\ of\ allocated\ energy\ on\ sectors$$

#### Investments

Inputs :
- Investments [Trillion $] for sector S (for each sector, fixed or design variable)

Output:
- Total investments 

$$ Total\ investments\ = Sum\ of\ investments\ on\ sectors\ $$
