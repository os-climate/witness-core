About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water, and the remaining lands are composed of 71% of what we call habitable lands (i.e. usable for human activities), 10% glacier and 19% barren land.

The land use model focuses on habitable lands, which are shared between different activities:

- Land usage for food from crop and livestock
- Energy linked technologies land

The initial land distribution for habitable lands (50% for agriculture and 37% for forest in 2019) may vary with deforestation and reforestation.

The model's inputs are therefore:

- Food land surface coming from agriculture discipline
- Energy linked technologies and reforestation surface (for CCS purpose) coming from the energy mix discipline
- Forest surface evolution coming from forest discipline

For each year, the available forest and agricultural surface is computed with deforestation and reforestation inputs, and a constraint is calculated for each such as:

$$Agriculture\_demand\_constraint = (available\_agriculture\_surface - forest\_surface\_evolution - \\ (surface\_used\_for\_food + surface\_for\_energy))\\ / land\_use\_constraint\_ref$$
$$Forest\_demand\_constraint = (available\_forest\_surface + forest\_surface\_evolution - (surface\_for\_energy \\ + other\_forests))\\ / land\_use\_constraint\_ref$$

So that the optimizer will try to minimize the absolute value of the constraint to solve the optimization problem.

## Model inputs/outputs

This section lists the inputs and outputs of the model.

The model inputs are:

- **year start** is the starting year of the study.
- **year end** is the last year of the study.
- **Land demand by technology** represents the demand in land (Gha) for each technology in energy mix.
- **Total food land surface** is the food land surface computed in the crop model.
- **Forest surface** represents the forest surfaces computed in the forest model.
- **Land-use constraint reference** is the reference value for the land constraints computation.
- **Other Forest surface** is the value of non production forests

The model outputs are:

- **Land demand constraint** represents the constraints of land demand used in the optimization problems
- **Land surface** represents the computed global land surfaces for each land category.
- **Land surface details** represents the detailed computed surfaces by type of lands
- **Land surface for food** represents the land surface for food that is in input of the model.
