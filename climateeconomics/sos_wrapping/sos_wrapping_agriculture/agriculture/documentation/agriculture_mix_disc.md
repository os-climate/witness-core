# WITNESS Agriculture process documentation

This process gathers agriculture related activities such as crop and forest management. It covers three main aspects:

## Food

### Context (extracted from [^1])

Healthy, sustainable and inclusive food systems are critical to achieve the world’s development goals. Agricultural
development is one of the most powerful tools to end extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity, and feed a projected 9.7
billion people by 2050. Growth in the agriculture sector is two to four times more effective in raising incomes among
the poorest compared to other sectors. Analyses in 2016 found that 65% of poor working adults made a living through
agriculture.

Agriculture is also crucial to economic growth: in 2018, it accounted for 4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and
in some least developing countries, it can account for more than 25% of GDP.

But agriculture-driven growth, poverty reduction, and food security are at risk: Multiple shocks – from COVID-19 related
disruptions to extreme weather, pests, and conflicts – are impacting food systems, resulting in higher food prices and
growing hunger.

Accelerating climate change could further cut crop yields, especially in the world’s most food-insecure regions.
Agriculture, forestry, and land use change are responsible for about 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigation in the
agriculture sector is part of the solution to climate change.

Current food systems also threaten the people and planet health and generate unsustainable pollution and waste levels.

One third of food produced globally is either lost or wasted in 2021 [^3]. Addressing food loss and waste is critical to improve food and nutrition security, as well as help to meet climate goals and reduce stress on the environment.

Risks associated with poor diets are also the leading cause of death worldwide. Millions of people are either not eating
enough or eating the wrong types of food, resulting in a double burden of malnutrition that can lead to illnesses and
health crises. A 2021 report found that between 720 and 811 millions people went hungry in 2020, more than 10% of the
world's population.

Food insecurity can get worse diet quality and increases the risk of various forms of malnutrition, potentially leading to
undernutrition as well as people being overweight and obese. An estimated 3 billions people in the world cannot afford a
healthy diet.

### Modelization

Refer to Crop model documentation for more details on food modelization.

## Energy

### Context (extracted from [^2])

Crop and forest can also be used to produce energy, throught biomass which is renewable organic material that comes from
plants and animals. It was the largest source of total annual U.S. energy consumption until the mid-1800s. Biomass
continues to be an important fuel in many countries, especially for cooking and heating in developing countries. The use
of biomass fuels for transportation and for electricity generation is increasing in many developed countries as a means
of avoiding carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use. In 2020, biomass provided nearly 5 quadrillion British
thermal units (Btu) and about 5% of total primary energy use in the United States.

Biomass contains stored chemical energy from the sun. Plants produce biomass through photosynthesis. Biomass can be
burned directly for heat or converted to renewable liquid and gaseous fuels through various processes.

Biomass sources for energy include:

- Wood, wood processing wastes—firewood, wood pellets, wood chips, lumber and furniture mill sawdust, waste, black liquor from pulp and paper mills
- Agricultural crops, waste materials—corn, soybeans, sugar cane, switchgrass, woody plants, algae, crop and
  food processing residues
- Biogenic materials in municipal solid waste—paper, cotton, wool products, food, yard, and wood wastes
- Animal manure and human sewage

We consider several methods for production:

- Crops
- Managed wood
- Unmanaged wood

**Biomass to energy conversion:**

Biomass is converted to energy through various processes, including:

- Direct combustion (burning) to produce heat
- Thermochemical conversion to produce solid, gaseous, and liquid fuels
- Chemical conversion to produce liquid fuels
- Biological conversion to produce liquid and gaseous fuels

## CO2 emissions

It gathers greenhous gaz from Crop and Forest models and send it to the Carbon Emission model.
